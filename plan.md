# Define a clear goal

I want to learn the full stack applications(MERN) and data structures.

## Are you commited to this?

Why your previous project failed? Aren't you commited to your goals then ?

1. Health.(Eating unnecessary outside food)
2. Coming late from office.
3. Disturbance in between study sessions.

- Frontend + Backend: Compared to other things I was contemplating for my project, Javascript is a language which can used on both the frontend and the backend. This means it will help me levelup as a full stack developer.
- Interview: By learning the data structure and algorithms. I am opening myself for vast opportunities.

Note: **DO NOT QUIT THIS PROJECT UNTILL YOU ARE DONE WITH IT**
