# Define a clear goal

I want to learn the full stack applications and data structures.

## Are you commited to this?

Why your previous project failed? Aren't you commited to your goals then ?

1. Health.(Eating unnecessary outside food)
2. Coming late from office.
3. Disturbance in between study sessions.

Yes, I am committed to this project. I need to know just one application that I can built from scratch so I will have overall idea how an application are build in real. Data structures and algo are your best friend for your interview or your dream job. You can not go far without this.
